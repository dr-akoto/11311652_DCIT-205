### STEPS BY STEP APPROACH IN CLONING
1. If you don't have Git installed on your computer, download it from git-scm.com.
   
2. Create a GitHub account at github.com to access its features.

3. Tell Git who you are by running these commands in your terminal, replacing "YourName" and "your.email@example.com" with your details:
    git config --global user.name "YourName"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

4. Fork the Repository:
Find the repository you want to work on on GitHub and click "Fork" in the top-right corner. This creates your copy of the project.

5. Clone to Your Machine:
Open your terminal and use git clone with the repository's URL to bring it to your computer:

6. Jump In:
Move into your project folder: cd <repository_directory>

7.  Create a Branch:
If you're adding a new feature or fixing something, create a branch to keep things organized: git checkout -b <branch_name>

8. Make Your Magic Happen:
Open your code editor, make the changes you want, and save.

9. Stage Your Changes:
Let Git know what you've done:
  Copy code
  git add .

10. Commit Your Work:
Capture your changes with a short, clear message:
  Copy code
  git commit -m "Your commit message here"

11. Share Your Brilliance:
If you made a new branch, share it on GitHub:
  Copy code
  git push origin <branch_name>

12. Pull Request Time:
On GitHub, you'll see a prompt to create a pull request. Click it, follow the steps, and send your changes to the original project.

Great job! You have successfully cloned a repository, personalized it, and contributed like a coding expert.
